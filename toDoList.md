# Things to do

## High-priority fixes

### OpenCVFacade

- [ ] Break out compose into a separate function
- [ ] saveImage should have more robust file output checking

## Low-priority improvements

### All

- [x] denote overrided functions in first sentence of function
- [ ] reduce Javadoc linking to one link per reference per class
- [ ] Use generated Javadocs to improve Javadocs (perpetual)

### Gui

- [ ] Debug and ensure GUI is written properly

### TesseractFacade

- [x] parse text-based input?
	- Determined to be unnecessary, as further data filtering is all that is required.
